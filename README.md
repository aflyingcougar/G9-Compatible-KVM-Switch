# **Samsung G9-Compatible KVM Switch**

## **Purpose**
The goal of this project is to design a KVM switch with a combination of features that, to my knowledge, does not yet exist. After hours of research and purchasing several different KVMs, there wasn't a single KVM that met the requirements of my current home-office setup. The following paragraphs will describe the current home-office hardware and the relevant technical specifications.
